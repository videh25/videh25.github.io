    My most ambitious project in BTech, I along with 3 of my final year batchmates led a team of 13 BTech students to create a tinkering event for 300 BTech Freshers. 

    Our aim was to create a mechanical mirror, consisting of 300 servo motors, camera and a wooden frame. The camera captured the image of a person standing in front, a Raspberry Pi processed the data and  controlled 300 servo motors on the frame to replicate a pixelated version of what stood in front.

    Even though our endeavor may not have ended in the success we had hoped for, the journey was incredibly fulfilling. The experience of daring to dream something ambitious, rallying teams toward shared goals, coordinating with authorities, and orchestrating the event on the final day was nothing short of complete.
