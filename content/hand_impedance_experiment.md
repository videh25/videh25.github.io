    As a part of the course, Human-Robot Interaction, Shail Jadav (PhD student at IITGn) and I devised an experiment to study the effect of a divergent force field on the impedance of the human arm.
    
    Human hand reaction incorporates some impedance to stabilize against the external and internal disturbances. For example, when trying to hold a 10 kg dumbbell, any disturbance that displaces your hand is countered by the musclesâ€™ stiffness and other reflexes. This experiment was conducted to measure the impedance under a divergent force field (where more stabilization is needed).
    
    The experimental setup consisted of a two-link manipulandum (to measure the position of hand) using which the subject applied diametrical force on a semicircular (to simulate divergent field) force measurement unit.
