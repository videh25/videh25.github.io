  Well, I needed an introduction to the path planning algorithms and here is the project that came out of it. I referred to youtube videos and research papers, also learnt from friends (thanks to Gaurav Viramgami). And this is what is I came up with: A python-based implementation from scratch (using basic libraries) of the four most popular path planning algorithms (Djikstras, A*, RRT and RRT*).

  Tried my best to incorporate OOPs and doxygen comments in my code. :)
