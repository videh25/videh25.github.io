  As a part of submission for Flipkart GRiD 3.0 Robotics Challenge, we had designed and manufactured a mobile robot with 3-D printed stand-offs and MDF sheets. 
  
  As per the competition guideline, the robot had to carry square shaped parcels and drop them at specified locations. It was really interesting to choose from a multiple mechanism that can achieve the same objective and to accommodate for other components (batteries, Aruco markers, PCBs), all while considering the manufacturability of the bot.
