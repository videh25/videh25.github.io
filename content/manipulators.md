    This project was developed as a series of assignments in the Robotics course offered by Prof. Harish PM. Developed 3D dynamic simulations of SCARA, PUMA and Stanford-type manipulators. Also, implemented  various controllers on each of them.

    The dynamics equations of these manipulations are calculated in the program given only the DH-parameters and linksâ€™ inertial properties.
