    Got some hands-on manufacturing experience when we were asked to restore a 3 year old rusted GoKart made by a senior batch. 	

    We de-rusted the Gokart which had been exposed to 3 years of sunlight and rain, installed new spindle rods, replaced old brakes, pedal springs and tyres, and welded a new holder for the steering wheel. 

    THE SMELL OF OIL AND RAW METAL. <3
