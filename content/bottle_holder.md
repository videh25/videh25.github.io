  If you have ever gone jogging or running, you must know this dilemma. You have to carry a bottle with you (staying hydrated is important!) but carrying the bottle in your swaying hand makes the activity so uncomfortable!

  Here is my take on the problem, trying to solve it with a product to hold your bottle while jogging. The holder rests on your upper arm, reducing the uncomfortability for you while swaying your arms. It was great to do this project as an introduction to ergonomic design and prototyping!
